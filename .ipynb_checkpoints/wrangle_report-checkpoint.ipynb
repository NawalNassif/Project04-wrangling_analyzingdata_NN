    "###### **This project is being set to master Data wrangling and Data cleaning as a Data Analyst.** \n",
    "The Dataset that will be wrangled is the tweet archive of twitter user **`@dog_rates`** which is also known as **`WeRateDogs.`**\n",
    "WeRateDogs is a twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These rating almost always have a denonminator of 10; but the numerators almost always greater than 10 (11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc.). Because **`\"they're good dogs Brent\"`as per the founder of this page \"Matt Nelson\".** \n",

    "###### To gathering the required data, we need to work with three datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. The WeRateDogs Twitter Archive:\n",
    "This file is provided by Udacity as a csv file **`\"twitter_archive_enhanced.csv\"`**. I download and upload this file in the Project Workspace and read it using the function `read_csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#####  2. The tweet image predictions:\n",
    "This file **`\"image_predictions.tsv\"`** is provided by Udacity through a URL [image_predictions](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/August/599fd2ad_image-predictions/image-predictions.tsv). I use the Requests library to download the file programmatically in the Project Workspace.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. Additional data from the Twitter API\n",
    "After creating a developer application on twitter, I use my consumer and secret Keys to access the twitter data (code provided by Udacity). And by using tweets IDs in the WeRateDogs Twitter archive, query the Twitter API for each tweet's JSON data using Python's Tweepy library and store each tweet's entire set of JSON data in a file called **`\"tweet_json.txt\"`** file. Noting that I refer to the codes available on github of \"Meet Patel\" [meet3012](https://github.com/meet3012/We-Rate-Dogs-Twitter-Archive-Data-Wrangling/blob/master/Wrangle_Act.ipynb) to create and collect the above data."
