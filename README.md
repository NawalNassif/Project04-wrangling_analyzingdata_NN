# WeRateDogs_DataAnalysisProject04_NN
Wrangling and Analyze data using Python and its libraries. 

This project was submitted as part of the nanodegree data analyst certification process.

Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, you will gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, 
assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. This is called data wrangling. You will document your wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, 
plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries) and/or SQL.

The dataset that you will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. 
WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. 
The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." 
WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.

WeRateDogs downloaded their Twitter archive and sent it to Udacity via email exclusively for you to use in this project. 
This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017. More on this soon.

In this project, I wrangle data from Twitter user @dog_rates's tweet archive, better known as WeRateDogs, 
to develop fascinating and trustworthy analysis and visualizations. I collect information from a multitude of sources. 
Data is available in a variety of formats, so I evaluate its quality and tidiness before cleaning it. 
After cleaning the data, I used the matplotlib packages to analyze and visualize it.
